# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive multi-organization SaaS application template that serves as a production-ready foundation for any SaaS business. The template provides essential functionality including authentication, user management, subscription billing, security settings, and a modern dashboard interface. Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Convex DB, the application emphasizes security, scalability, modularity, and modern development practices with Docker containerization for both frontend and backend components.
