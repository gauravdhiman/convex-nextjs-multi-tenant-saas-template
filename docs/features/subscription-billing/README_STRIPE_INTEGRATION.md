## 🧪 Testing Credit Consumption

Use the demo tab in the billing dashboard to test:

```typescript
// Example: Consume credits for a service
const { useCreditsForService } = useCredits(organizationId);

await useCreditsForService(
  10,                    // Credits to consume
  "AI Text Generation",  // Description
  "text-generation"      // Service identifier
);
```

## 🎯 Integration Examples

### Check Subscription Status
```typescript
const subscription = useQuery(api.subscriptions.getOrganizationSubscription, {
  organizationId
});

const hasActiveSubscription = subscription?.status === "active";
```

### Consume Credits in Your Services
```typescript
import { useCredits } from '../hooks/useCredits';

function MyAIService({ organizationId }) {
  const { useCreditsForService, hasEnoughCredits } = useCredits(organizationId);

  const generateText = async () => {
    if (!hasEnoughCredits(10)) {
      alert('Not enough credits!');
      return;
    }

    try {
      await useCreditsForService(10, 'AI Text Generation', 'ai-text');
      // Proceed with your AI service
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Credit consumption failed:', error);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={generateText}>Generate Text (10 credits)</button>;
}
```

### Feature Gating Based on Plan
```typescript
function PremiumFeature({ organizationId }) {
  const subscription = useQuery(api.subscriptions.getOrganizationSubscription, {
    organizationId
  });

  if (!subscription || subscription.planId === 'starter') {
    return <div>Upgrade to Pro to access this feature</div>;
  }

  return <div>Premium feature content</div>;
}
```
